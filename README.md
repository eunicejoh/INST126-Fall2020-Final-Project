## Final Project: Data Analysis - Nutritional Comparison Tool for Various Cereals
### Group Members: Eunice Oh, Dante Cavalier, Zijing Wang, Jalen Rawles, Noah Shaw

## Overview
Many choose cereal as their breakfast meal and there are various brands and kinds, all of which also have differing nutritional values. In other words, some are healthier while others are not. With nutritional value becoming increasingly more prevalent in society, itâ€™s important for consumers to be health-conscious of what they intake. Furthermore, we wanted to provide a comparison tool for consumers to use before making a choice of which cereal they may want to buy and give suggestions based on what they may be looking for in a particular cereal.

Our goal is to provide a comparison of nutritional values of different cereals to inform consumers about their cereal choices as well as encourage healthier eating habits.

## Installation
Please ensure that Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook is downloaded. Additionally, please have a cereal.csv file on hand. Then, run the ipynb file in a new Jupyter Lab or Notebook.

## How It Works
Our program will aim to help the user complete 3 different tasks. The first function our program will have is allowing the user to research information regarding a specific cereal. The user would tell the program what cereal they would like to research, and it would return nutritional and informational data about the cereal such as the manufacturer, how many calories per serving, and how many grams of fat are in it. Our program will also provide visual representations of some of the information using graphs and charts to better convey information to the user. The user can research as many individual cereals as they would like before being prompted with the next function. The next capability or program will have is allowing the user to compare data between two different cereals. The user would select two cereals they would like to compare and return the data from both cereals in a format that allows the user to compare them. The user will be able to continue comparing as many cereals as they wish before being prompted with the final question. The last question our program will ask the user is if the user has any specific needs regarding their cereal choice. For example, if the the user wants to be shown the cereals with the lease amount of sugar or wants cereals from a specific manufacturer, the program will sort the data based on the user's parameters and provide the user with their requested information using charts, graphs, etc. Similarly to the other two functions, the user can do this as many times as they would like. After going through all three functions, the program will end with a goodbye message.
