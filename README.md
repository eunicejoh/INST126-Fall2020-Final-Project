## Final Project: Data Analysis - Nutritional Comparison Tool for Various Cereals
### Group Members: Eunice Oh, Dante Cavalier, Zijing Wang, Jalen Rawles, Noah Shaw

## Overview
Many choose cereal as their breakfast meal and there are various brands and kinds, all of which also have differing nutritional values. In other words, some are healthier while others are not. With nutritional value becoming increasingly more prevalent in society, itâ€™s important to be health-conscious of what consumers intake. Furthermore, we wanted to provide a comparison tool for consumers to use before making a choice of which cereal they may want to buy and give suggestions based on what they may be looking for in a particular cereal.

Our goal is to provide a comparison of nutritional values of different cereals to inform consumers about their cereal choices as well as encourage healthier eating habits.

## Installation
Please ensure that Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook is downloaded. Additionally, please have a cereal.csv file on hand, within the relevant folder. Then, run the ipynb file in a new Jupyter Lab tab.
